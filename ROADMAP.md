# OSI Roadmap (Community-Informed)

This roadmap synthesizes community discussions and voting signals from the [OSI GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions) board. It groups work into three categories:

- **Current Efforts / Working Groups** — strategic initiatives with active working groups driving spec evolution now
- **Future Efforts** — strategic initiatives planned for future working groups
- **Enhancements & Additions** — incremental improvements that extend the current model

---

## Current Efforts / Working Groups

These are the strategic initiatives where working groups are actively driving spec evolution.

---

### Metric Semantics & Core Semantic Model

**Goal:** Enable expressive, composable, and well-defined semantic models with clear entity, relationship, and grain semantics.

**Motivation:**
The current model lacks sufficient support for metrics at different grains, filters, aggregation semantics, and relationships between metrics. Ambiguity in how entities, joins, and grain are represented limits interoperability.

**Key Discussions:**

- [Top-level "metrics" vs. dataset-level "measures"](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/29)
- [Cumulative and other "expansions" to metrics](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/39)
- [Structured aggregation_method for Metrics](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/19)
- [Add "entity / grain" as a first-class concept](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/12)
- [Add explicit datasets reference to Metrics](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/18)
- [Relationship Semantics](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/24)
- [Complex Relationship Definitions](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/4)
- [Make Relationship Cardinality Explicit](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/50)
- [Inner join in relationships](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/11)
- [Support for cross-dataset dimensions & single-dataset measures](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/27)
- [Semantic Filters](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/5)
- [BIG IDEA: add metrics trees / input-output relations between metrics](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/40)
- [Primary Key vs Unique Keys redundancy](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/15)
- [Clarifying the Semantic Intent of Primary Keys vs. Unique Constraints](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/119)

**Roadmap Deliverables:**

- Standard metrics specification language
- First-class aggregation, relationship, and grain semantics, including a specification that documents the expected behavior that the community has aligned on
- Support for derived and cumulative metrics
- Explicit entity modeling
- Enhanced relationship definitions & capabilities
- Cross-domain modeling support
- Reusable semantic filter definitions

---

### Catalog Integration & Semantic Services

**Goal:** Integrate OSI with data catalogs and enable centralized semantic services.

**Motivation:**
Semantic models need to be discoverable, governable, and shareable across systems.

**Roadmap Deliverables:**

- Integration patterns with catalogs (e.g., Polaris)
- Standalone semantic service / registry
- Discovery, versioning, and access control for OSI models

**Related Issues & PRs:**

- [PR #94 — Add Apache Polaris converter module](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/pull/94)
- [Issue #107 — Proposal: Adopt ontology-query as an Ontology Access Layer tool](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/issues/107)

---

### Ontology & Semantic Interoperability

**Goal:** Enable OSI to describe business concepts independently of physical data layout, supporting ontology-based semantic models and cross-model conceptual alignment.

**Motivation:**
Many semantic representations (e.g., Palantir, Goldman Sachs Legend) use ontologies to define meaning, and dimensional semantic models naturally layer on top of these. OSI currently solves structural interoperability — any tool can read and write semantic models in a common format — but it does not yet solve conceptual interoperability, where different models may describe the same business concept using different names or structures. An ontology layer would let organizations define canonical business concepts (Customer, Order, Product, etc.) independently of where the data lives and map physical semantic models back to shared definitions.

**Key Discussions:**

- [Proposal: Extend OSI spec to interchange with semantic models based on relational ontologies](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/22)
- [Support for Ontologies](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/101)
- [Shared Semantics OSI](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/108)
- [Plans to support other data models than tabular data?](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/68)

**Roadmap Deliverables:**

- Ontology layer describing business concepts above the physical/logical semantic model
- Schema mappings between ontology concepts and OSI datasets/fields
- Support for relational ontologies and non-tabular data models
- Shared semantic definitions enabling conceptual interoperability across models

**Related Issues & PRs:**

- [PR #124 — Support ontologies and schema mappings from the logical layer](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/pull/124)
- [PR #125 — Proposal semantics foundation](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/pull/125)
- [Issue #107 — Proposal: Adopt ontology-query as an Ontology Access Layer tool](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/issues/107)

---

## Future Efforts

These strategic initiatives are planned for future working groups as the spec matures.

---

### Dataset Abstraction & Logical Modeling

**Goal:** Decouple semantic definitions from physical storage.

**Motivation:**
Users want reusable semantic models independent of underlying tables or views.

- [Issue #104 — First-class representation of file-backed datasets (e.g. Parquet)](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/issues/104)

---

### Semantic Query Language & Reference Engine

**Goal:** Define a standard query interface for interacting with OSI models and provide a canonical implementation for interpreting and executing them.

**Motivation:**
Consumers (BI tools, AI systems, APIs) need a consistent way to query semantic models independent of underlying SQL dialects. A reference engine ensures consistent interpretation of the spec and accelerates ecosystem adoption.

**Roadmap Deliverables:**

- Standard semantic query language (OSI-native or SQL-extended)
- Mapping from semantic queries → execution plans
- Support for metrics, dimensions, filters, and relationships
- Reference compiler from OSI → SQL
- Canonical handling of joins, aggregations, and filters
- Test suite to validate conformance across implementations

**Motivation:**
Organizations repeatedly recreate similar semantic models (e.g., SaaS, finance, retail). Standardized models can drive faster adoption and consistency.

**Roadmap Deliverables:**

- Curated domain-specific semantic model templates
- Best-practice metric and dimension definitions by industry
- Interoperable model packages aligned with OSI

---

## Enhancements & Additions (Incremental Improvements)

These items improve usability, clarity, and completeness without fundamentally changing the spec.

---

### Naming, Terminology, and UX Improvements

**Goal:** Align OSI vocabulary with how practitioners think about semantic models, and improve the authoring experience.

**Motivation:**
Several naming conventions in the current spec create confusion or clash with established industry terminology. Clearer naming reduces onboarding friction and improves readability of OSI definitions.

**Roadmap Deliverables:**

- Revised terminology that reflects community consensus (e.g., "Dimension" over "Field")
- Consistent naming conventions for source references, descriptions, and display labels

**Key Discussions:**

- [Rename Field to Dimension](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/33)
- [Rename Dataset.source to avoid conflation with where an entity was first defined](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/34)
- [Generalise description field](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/36)
- [Introduce a concept for "Display name"](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/37)

**Related Issues & PRs:**

- [PR #91 — Change vendor_name from enum to free-form string](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/pull/91)

---

### Data Types and Field Semantics

**Goal:** Provide native support for rich data typing so downstream tools can interpret fields without guesswork.

**Motivation:**
Consuming systems (BI tools, AI agents, dashboards) frequently need to know whether a field represents a currency, a physical unit, or sensitive data — but this context is lost in the current spec and must be re-inferred or hard-coded per tool.

**Roadmap Deliverables:**

- First-class unit and currency annotations on measures and dimensions
- Standardized semantic field type taxonomy (dimension type, data type, PII classification)

**Key Discussions:**

- [Native support for units](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/42)
- [Native support for currencies](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/43)
- [Semantic Field Types: dimension_type, data_type, and pii_classification](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/55)
- [Add portable field physical metadata to OSI](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/110)

**Related Issues & PRs:**

- [Issue #58 — New attribute: contain personal data](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/issues/58)
- [Issue #59 — New attribute: confidential indicator](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/issues/59)
- [PR #66 — Add personal data and confidentiality indicators](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/pull/66)
- [PR #113 — Add datatype field to Field and Metric; reframe is_time as role marker](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/pull/113)

---

### Extended Metadata for OSI

**Goal:** Introduce a lightweight, optional metadata layer that improves how data is interpreted, presented, and consumed — without affecting execution semantics.

**Motivation:**
OSI standardizes structural and logical semantics well, but there is limited support for conveying interpretability context such as display conventions, default aggregation behavior, KPI polarity, sorting preferences, and alignment to external semantic concepts. These details are often redefined or inferred inconsistently across developers, BI tools, and AI systems.

**Roadmap Deliverables:**

- [Extended Metadata Proposal for OSI](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/issues/100) — optional, backward-compatible metadata fields (e.g., `measurement`, `display_format`, `semantic_type`, `default_aggregation`, `desired_direction`, `default_sort`, `semantic_mappings`)
- Richer application-specific extension points beyond `custom_extensions`
- Sample value annotations for documentation and AI grounding

**Key Discussions:**

- [Expand custom_extensions to be more suitable for application-specific metadata](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/30)
- [Sample values](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/7)
- [Governance metadata hooks](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/13) *(also informs strategic governance work)*
- [Optional "positive direction" on metrics](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/41)
- [Add default_aggregation to Field](https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI/discussions/115)

---

### Developer Experience & Documentation

**Goal:** Lower the barrier to adopting and correctly using OSI through better guidance, examples, and tooling-friendly formatting.

**Motivation:**
New adopters and tool authors need clearer documentation, real-world samples, and support for rich-text descriptions to effectively author and consume OSI models.

**Roadmap Deliverables:**

- Comprehensive usage guides with annotated examples, especially for AI context fields
- Data modeling best-practice documentation
- Markdown support in description fields for richer inline documentation

**Key Discussions:**

---

### Tooling & Ecosystem Support

**Goal:** Provide reference tooling that makes it easy to validate, convert, and adopt OSI models.

**Motivation:**
Broad ecosystem adoption depends on practical tools that let teams validate their models against the spec and convert between OSI and existing vendor formats without manual effort.
